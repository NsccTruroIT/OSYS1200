1. Type a new password for Jacob and hit **enter**.
2. Next we can use that password try it‚Ä¶ `echo $NewP` then **press tab.** See! It found the variable name we assigned in step 4 $NewPassword.
3. Ok press enter. It should show something like System.Security.SecureString‚Ä¶. Well that makes sense. It‚Äôs secure so it won‚Äôt show the actual password.
4. Now let‚Äôs use it to reset Jacobs‚Äôs password:
    
    ```powershell
    Set-LocalUser -Name Jacob -Password $NewPassword
    ```
    
5. **Take a screenshot** and close Powershell.

## Activity 3 ‚Äì Profile Management

### Part A ‚Äì Public Profile

This is pretty slick‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say you need to make sure every user on the system has a shortcut to an important App. One way to accomplish this is to create the shortcut in the public profile. Try creating a shortcut to Discord (or any other app, you can just copy an existing shortcut) and saving it to **C:\Users\Public\Public Desktop** (note this folder may be hidden by default, in class I demonstrated how to show hidden files in explorer by clicking View‚ÜíHidden Items ). Check to see if the new shortcut showed up on your desktop. Test your solution by logging in as a different user and see if the shortcut is there. **Create a set of instructions for other admins to follow to add additional shortcuts to the public profile.**

### Part B ‚Äì Types of Profiles

There are a few more types of profiles, we‚Äôll explore some later in the course. For now **please describe each of the following, include links to any resource that might be beneficial**:

1. Default Profile
2. Mandatory Profile
3. Roaming Profile

üí° Not sure where to start? Well google, but maybe ChatGPT or Windows Copilot? Remember.. just be transparent. If you use AI, consider including the prompt(s) that helped you understand.

## Activity 4 ‚Äì Start Menu Mastery (Windows 11 Edition)
Objective:
Customize the Windows 11 Start menu, export the layout, and apply it using Local Group Policy.

Steps:
1. Prepare the Environment
Start VN located 172.16.144.118
2. Customize the Start Menu
Click the **Start** button and search for Paint.
**Right-click** Paint and select Pin to Start.

üìù Note: In Windows 11, pinned apps appear in the Pinned section of the Start menu. You can drag and drop to rearrange them.

3. Organize Pinned Apps
Open the Start menu.
Drag **Paint**, **Computer Management**, and **Windows PowerShell** to the top row.
Right-click on one of them and select Move to group or Create new group (if available).
Name the group **Tools**.
4. Export the Start Layout
Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the following commands:

```powershell
md C:\Start
Export-StartLayout -Path C:\Start\StartMenuLayout.json
```
Open the exported layout:

```PowerShell
notepad C:\Start\StartMenuLayout.json
```
Review the JSON structure. Note the group name and apps listed.
5. Apply Layout via Group Policy
**Press Win + R, type mmc, and press Enter.**

In the Console1 window:

6. Test the Layout
In PowerShell, enable a test user (e.g., Jacob):

```PowerShell

```
Sign out and sign in as Jacob.
Verify that the Tools group appears in the Start menu.
Take a screenshot for your lab documentation.
7. Revert the Policy
Sign back in as your admin user.
In the Console1 window, double-click Start Layout again.
Set it to Not Configured and click OK.
Close all windows. Do not save the MMC console.

## Activity 5 - Groups! MMC Vs PS

Groups will be used to simplify the assignment of privileges and file system permissions. We‚Äôll see this more when we explore storage devices and Windows security. For now, let‚Äôs try the basics: 

### Part A - Creating Groups

1. Press **`Win + X`** on your keyboard to open the Power User Menu.
2. Let‚Äôs create another group via MMC. Select **Computer Management** from the menu to open the Computer Management console.
3. In the Computer Management console, expand **Local Users and Groups** in the left panel.
4. Right-click on the **Groups** folder and choose **New Group.**
5. In the "New Group" dialog box:
    - Enter a "Group Name" of `redteam`
    - Provide a "Description" for the group like `This group will pose as a threat actor and is authorized to conduct a variety of attacks and exploits targeting hosts on our network.`
    - This would be a convenient time to add users to our group, but we‚Äôll do that after it‚Äôs created. **Grab a screenshot** instead!
6. Click **Create** to create the group. Close the Create Group dialogue window.
7. But wait‚Ä¶ If you guessed that we might need another group, you were right!  Leave Computer Management open, and launch Powershell as Administrator. Press **`Win + X`** on your keyboard.
8. Select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**
9. In the PowerShell window, you can use the **`New-LocalGroup`** cmdlet to create a new local group. Here's the basic syntax:

```powershell

New-LocalGroup -Name "GroupName"

```

Replace "GroupName" with `blueteam`

```powershell

New-LocalGroup -Name "blueteam"

```

You can verify that the group has been created by using the **`Get-LocalGroup`** cmdlet and **Grab a Screenshot!**:

```powershell

Get-LocalGroup

```

<aside>
‚ùì Up for a challenge? Remember we added a description to redteam try using powershell  to ad the following description to  blueteam:  `This group will valiantly defend our confidentiality, Integrity and ensure Availability.` **Hint**: use `Set-LocalGroup` and specify the group using the `-Name` option

</aside>

### Part B - Manage Group Members

1. Return to **Computer Management**. Expand the groups folder and right click on the **redteam** group.
2. Choose **Properties** and under Members click **Add‚Ä¶**
3. In the "Select Users" dialog box, click **Advanced** to search for users.
4. Click **Find Now** to list all available users on the system.
5. Select the Bad user, and click **OK.** Click **OK** again to add the selected users to the group. Notice that we could also remove a user from this group from this same Properties window. 
6. AND click **OK** one more time to save the group properties.
7. To modify group membership later, right-click on the group in the Groups folder and choose "Properties."
8. Now let‚Äôs add Jacob to the blueteam, but since we only want to add Jacob we‚Äôll configure it on his account (not the group).
9. Under Computer Management expand **Users,** right-click **Jacob** and click **Properties.**
10. Click on the **Member Of** tab and click **Add‚Ä¶**
11. In the "Select Groups" dialog box, click **Advanced** to search for users.
12. Click **Find Now** to list all available users on the system.
13. Select the blueteam group, and click **OK.** Click **OK** again to add the selected users to the group. Notice that we could also remove this user from a group from this same Properties window. **Grab a screenshot!**
14. AND click **OK** one more time to save the group properties.
