## Activity 2 – OneDrive

### Part A – Sharing Files

Find a partner to explore file shares with (or share with me!). For this activity, you can use either the local OneDrive Client or **OneDrive** Online, although you may find some features are only available online.

Create the following shared items and **grab a screenshot** of the share configuration for each before you click "Apply" or "Send."

1.  **Folder named "Group Work":** Share this **directly with a specific person** (your partner or me) using their name or email address. Grant them **"Can edit"** permissions.
2.  **File named "Secret Stuff":** Share this by creating a link. In the link settings, make sure to set the permission to **"Can view" (read-only)**.
3.  **Folder named "Sharing is Caring":** Share this using an **"Anyone with the link"** option. Grant **"Can edit"** access and set the link to **expire in one month**.

### Part B – Managing Your Shares

Now that you have set up your shares, answer the following questions.

1.  Is there a way to view a single list of all the files and folders you are currently sharing with others? (Hint: This is much easier to find on OneDrive Online than in the local client).
    * **List the steps** to find the **"Shared by you"** list.
    * **Grab a screenshot** of this "Shared by you" view.

2.  From that list, find your **"Secret Stuff"** file. How can you check *who* it is shared with and, more importantly, how would you **stop sharing** that file?
    * **List the steps** to go to **"Manage access"** for the file and remove the sharing link.
    * **Grab a screenshot** of the "Manage access" panel for that file.

## Activity 3 – What's New in Windows 11 25H2?

### Introduction

As IT professionals, one of our most important skills is staying current. Operating systems are constantly evolving with new features, security patches, and interface changes. Your role will often be to understand these changes and explain them to others.

In this activity, you will research the latest major update for Windows 11, **version 25H2**, and compare it to the previous version, **version 24H2**, which you have been using.

4.  **Feature 4:**
5.  **Feature 5:**

### Part B: Feature Deep Dive & Screenshots

From your list in Part A, choose the **three (3) features** you believe are the most important or interesting for an end-user.

For each of your chosen three, find an article, blog post, or video that clearly demonstrates the change. **Grab a screenshot** of this new feature in action.

Below each screenshot, **write a brief description (in your own words)** explaining what the feature does and how it is different from the way things worked in version 24H2.

### Part D – AI Tool Disclosure

**Important:** If you used an AI assistant (like Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to help you brainstorm, research, or summarize information for this activity, you **must** disclose it here.

Using these tools is permitted, but as a future IT professional, you are responsible for validating the accuracy of the information they provide.

**Task:** If you used an AI tool, list which tool(s) you used. Then, in 1-2 sentences, explain what you learned from the AI and how you verified that its information was correct.

*(Write your AI disclosure here. If you did not use an AI, simply write "No AI tools were used.")*
